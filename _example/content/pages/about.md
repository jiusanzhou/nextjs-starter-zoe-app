目前从事**云原生**相关的开发工作 👨‍💻 。
过往的工作经历包含爬虫系统、逆向、硬件电路等。
平时会用 `Golang`，`React` ⚛️，`Flutter` 和正在学习的 `Rust` 🦀 等技术栈来实现自己在工具或平台领域的想法 💡 。
目前居住在杭州，中国 🌏 。

## 技术栈

我使用 `Golang`, `Python`, `Rust`, `JavaScript` 等语言进行开发。

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello Golang!")
}
```

## 理念

> **任何业务逻辑都应向「无码平台」演进。**

## Welcome to StackEdit!

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me.

### Files

StackEdit stores your files in your browser, which means all your files are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**

### Create files and folders

The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.

### Synchronization

Synchronization is one of the biggest features of StackEdit. It enables you to synchronize any file in your workspace with other files stored in your **Google Drive**, your **Dropbox** and your **GitHub** accounts.

There are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other:

- The workspace synchronization will sync all your files, folders and settings automatically.
- The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one or multiple files.

### Markdown extensions

StackEdit extends the standard Markdown syntax by adding extra **Markdown extensions**, providing you with some nice features.

#### SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities.

| ASCII                          | HTML                         |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `'Isn't this fun?'`           | 'Isn't this fun?'            |
| `"Isn't this fun?"`           | "Isn't this fun?"            |
| `-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash` | -- is en-dash, --- is em-dash |

#### KaTeX

You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using KaTeX:

The *Gamma function* satisfying `Γ(n) = (n-1)!` is via the Euler integral.

#### UML diagrams

You can render UML diagrams using Mermaid. For example:

```
sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
```
